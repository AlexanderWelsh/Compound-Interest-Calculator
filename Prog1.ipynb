    "#### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should allow the user to enter three values: a principle balance, an interest rate, and a number of years. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity's sake, we will compound our interest once per year. In order to do so, create a function interest_calculator with three inputs, corresponding to the user inputs. They should have the default values 10000, .09, and 10, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your formula to calculate the interest will be Balance(Year + 1) = Balance * (1 + interest rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, starting with 10,000 and a 5% interest rate, the formula is 10,000 * (1 + .05) = 10,500. The next year would be 10,500 * (1 + .05) = 11,025 and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each year you will output the year number, and the value of the balance that year. \n"
